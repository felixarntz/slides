						<ul>
							<li>This is the form for opening a new ticket.</li>
							<li>Let's go through all fields in detail.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-summary.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Brief summary of the ticket description.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: If you're filing a bug, describe what's wrong.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;HTML comments in posts aren't handled correctly&quot;
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: If you're filing an enhancement or feature request, use a call-to-action-type direction.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;Encourage people to change default tagline&quot;
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-description.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Ticket content: May be as long or as short as you like, but be precise.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: Do not use empty phrases, be on point. Tone on Trac is rather formal, so try to avoid things like &quot;I would love to see this!&quot; or similar.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Pro tip: You may reference another ticket by entering <code>#{ticket_id}</code>, and it will automatically become a link.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;This was previously discussed in #40000.&quot;
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Pro tip: You may reference a specific changeset by entering <code>[{changeset_id}]</code>, and it will automatically become a link.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;The original bug was fixed in [40000].&quot;
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>All of this applies to comments on tickets as well.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-type.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Ticket type: Either <em>defect (bug)</em>, <em>enhancement</em> or <em>feature request</em>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The vast majority of tickets are for bugs or enhancements.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							It's usually not a good idea to open a feature request ticket out of the blue. New feature ideas should be discussed in advance with others and only be transformed into a ticket once the idea has enough traction to be viable for a possible inclusion in WordPress core.
							<br>
							&rarr; Furthermore, new features need to go through a special feature project workflow. See <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/">https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/31/iterating-on-feature-plugins/">https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/31/iterating-on-feature-plugins/</a> for more information.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							There is a fourth ticket type called <em>task (blessed)</em>. It is only available to component maintainers and committers and is intended to be used for task tickets, i.e. tickets that usually span multiple smaller sub-tickets to reach a bigger goal.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Differentiate between enhancements and feature requests!</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-version.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							This field should only be used when filing a bug.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							It should contain the number of the earliest version where the bug occurred. This is <em>not</em> necessarily the version of WordPress you are using.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If you're not sure which version to enter, leave the field blank, so someone else can add the information later.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Pro tip: If you already know where in the code the bug is coming from, you can use <code>svn blame {file}@r{changeset_id} | less</code> to work your way backwards and find out the earliest affected version.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: <code>svn blame src/wp-includes/post.php@r40000 | less</code><br>You can then use <code>400G</code> to go to line 400 and see the changeset number when that line was last changed.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-component.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The component to which the ticket belongs.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If it affects multiple components, choose the one it affects the most. You may further specify the related area by using focuses.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<img class="fragment" data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-focuses.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							A focus is something more general that usually spans across many, if not all WordPress core components.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							While specifying a component is required, focuses are optional.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If you file a ticket relates to multiple components and one of them is also available as a focus, use a mixture of component and focuses.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: If you want to file a bug in the REST API taxonomy controller, use the <em>Taxonomy</em> component and the <em>rest-api</em> focus.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Please do not simply choose <em>General</em>, unless it's truly a general ticket!</li>

					<h4>The advanced New Ticket form</h4>

					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced.png">

						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-milestone.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The milestone to which to assign the tickets. You may specify <em>Awaiting Review</em>, <em>Future Release</em>, the next major release or next minor release.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							When opening a ticket, you should usually keep this on <em>Awaiting Review</em> and ask for some initial feedback - especially if you're not filing a clear bug for which WordPress core is responsible.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Minor releases should only be used to fix regressions (bugs) from the latest major release. This has changed a bit since the new release cycle, but it's still something to strive for.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: Only assign tickets to the upcoming release if sufficient discussions have already happened and you consider it realistic for the changes to be done in time.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: If you close a ticket without a successful resolution (more on that later), you should completely remove any milestone from the ticket.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-keywords.png">

					<ul style="font-size:80%;">
						<li class="fragment">
							Specify one or more keywords to indicate the current status of the ticket and required steps.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							This is supposed to be dynamic throughout the ticket's lifecycle, so you can (and should) change it after opening the ticket as necessary.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Available keywords are:
							<ul style="font-size:60%;">
								<li><em>has-patch</em>: A working patch has been uploaded.</li>
								<li><em>needs-patch</em>: The ticket still requires a working patch.</li>
								<li><em>needs-refresh</em>: There is a working patch, but the circumstances have changed, so a new patch is required.</li>
								<li><em>reporter-feedback</em>: Feedback by the person who opened the ticket requested.</li>
								<li><em>dev-feedback</em>: Feedback by developers requested, for example to review a patch.</li>
								<li><em>2nd-opinion</em>: Feedback requested for concepts / ideas, to start a discussion.</li>
								<li><em>close</em>: The ticket should probably be closed, but another voice would be welcome.</li>
								<li><em>needs-testing</em>: The patch on the ticket needs to be thoroughly tested (usually used for new features).</li>
								<li><em>ui-feedback</em>: Feedback requested for the UI changes the ticket deals with.</li>
								<li><em>ux-feedback</em>: Feedback requested for the UX changes the ticket deals with.</li>
								<li><em>has-unit-tests</em>: Comprehensive unit tests have been uploaded for the ticket.</li>
								<li><em>needs-unit-tests</em>: The ticket still requires unit tests.</li>
								<li><em>needs-docs</em>: The patch on the ticket still needs proper documentation.</li>
								<li><em>needs-codex</em>: The changes from the ticket require changes in the WordPress Codex.</li>
								<li><em>has-screenshots</em>: Screenshots for UI issues / changes have been uploaded.</li>
								<li><em>needs-screenshots</em>: The ticket still requires screenshots for UI issues / changes.</li>
								<li><em>commit</em>: The ticket, patch and everything related has been properly reviewed and is ready for commit.</li>
								<li><em>early</em>: The changes proposed in the ticket should be committed early in a release cycle to allow for thorough testing.</li>
								<li><em>i18n-change</em>: The changes in the ticket include i18n string changes.</li>
								<li><em>good-first-bug</em>: The ticket qualifies as a bug that should be relatively easy to fix for new contributors. Experienced contributors should preferably keep off, unless it's urgent.</li>
								<li><em>fixed-major</em>: The ticket has already been fixed in trunk, but requires back-porting to an older release.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Component maintainers and committers may furthermore enter manual keywords, for example <em>needs-dev-note</em> for when a ticket requires a dev-note.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-priority.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The priority of the ticket. Can be <em>normal</em>, <em>low</em>, <em>high</em>, <em>lowest</em> or <em>highest omg bbq</em>. No, this is not a joke. 🔥
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Always keep this at <em>normal</em>, unless specific circumstances dictate the value to be different or the ticket changes are nit-picking and not really needed.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Don't ever use this to mark something as important because you want it to happen!
						</li>
					</ul>

					<img class="fragment" data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-severity.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The severity of the ticket, if it is a bug. Can be <em>normal</em>, <em>major</em>, <em>minor</em>, <em>trivial</em>, <em>critical</em> or <em>blocker</em>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Should usually remain <em>normal</em> as well. <em>critical</em> can be used if the bug needs to be fixed as soon as possible, while <em>blocker</em> indicates that it should be fixed soon so that work on another related ticket can proceed.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Again, don't ever use this to mark something as important because you want it to happen!
						</li>
					</ul>

				<section>
					<h4>Ticket Statuses</h4>

					<p>
						When you open a new ticket, its initial status will always be set to <em>new</em>.
					</p>

					<p data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">
						There are a few more statuses however:
					</p>

					<ul data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">
						<li>
							<em>accepted</em>: The changes proposed by the ticket are accepted for a future merge. Used rarely, as this is mostly implicit by the comments on the ticket.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em>assigned</em>: The ticket is assigned to an owner who will take care of the necessary work.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em>closed</em>: The ticket has been closed with a specific resolution, either as <em>fixed</em> or a negative resolution.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em>reopened</em>: The ticket had already been closed, but was reopened because it was not actually completed properly.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em>reviewing</em>: The ticket has an owner who will review the changes.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>A ticket owner is someone who is responsible for moving that ticket forward.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Ticket Resolutions</h4>

					<img data-src="assets/close-ticket-commit.png">

					<p style="margin-top:0;font-size:75%;">
						A ticket is automatically closed as <em>fixed</em>, when a commit message contains the phrase "Fixes #{ticket_id}.".
					</p>

					<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" data-src="assets/close-ticket-invalid.png">

					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="margin-top:0;font-size:75%;">
						If a ticket should not be fixed for a specific reason, it can be manually be closed with a proper resolution:
					</p>

					<ul class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="font-size:60%;">
						<li><em>invalid</em>: The ticket was not opened for a valid reason, for example when a bug only occurred because the reporter or a plugin clearly did something wrong.</li>
						<li><em>wontfix</em>: This may be considered a bug, but is not critical and cannot be fixed for (usually complex) legacy reasons.</li>
						<li><em>worksforme</em>: The issue described in the ticket cannot be recreated.</li>
						<li><em>maybelater</em>: This may be considered a bug, but is not critical and involves too heavy changes compared to the benefits. It may be reconsidered later.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Trac notifications</h4>

					<p>
						Once you open a ticket or comment on a ticket, you will automatically receive emails when that ticket is updated. In addition, you may manually subscribe to any ticket you're interested in.
						<br>
						But wait, there's more...
					</p>

					<img data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment" data-src="assets/trac-notifications-link.png">

					<ul data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">
						<li>
							On that page you can check components and focuses that you would like to receive all ticket updates for.
						</li>
						<li>
							You could also subscribe to the &quot;firehose&quot;, so that you receive emails for every update on every ticket.

					<h3>Creating patches</h3>

					<p>
						Patches are the code changes that are uploaded to the related ticket as attachments.
						<br>
						&rarr; How do you do it right?
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>The workflow for creating a patch</h4>

					<p>
						Either download and apply the patch manually and upload your new patch manually, or do it like a pro...
					</p>

					<pre data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment"><code>svn update
grunt patch:12345
# Do the code changes you need.
grunt upload_patch:12345
svn revert -R *
</code></pre>

					<small data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment"><em>12345</em> should be the ticket number.</small>

					<p data-fragment-index="1" class="fragment">
						If you wanna upload the patch manually, use <code>svn diff > 12345.diff</code> and then upload the file as an attachment to the ticket manually.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Always apply patches to the current trunk state.</li>
							<li>If there are multiple patches on the ticket, you can select which one to apply.</li>
							<li>Don't forget to <code>svn add</code> new files.</li>
							<li>Reset all your changes back to trunk state after you are done.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Best practices for writing patches</h4>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Creating a patch should usually be one of the last things you do in a ticket lifecycle. Of course, you can always write a patch to have a better explanation of what you're trying to achieve, but keep in mind that it might not be accepted.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Be patient, consider and discuss edge-cases. Letting a problem sink in for a while will improve the outcome.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Name your patch after the ticket number and use the <code>.diff</code> file extension in favor of <code>.patch</code>. If there are multiple patches on the ticket, an index number will automatically be appended once the patch is uploaded.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Writing a comment for the patch</h4>

					<ul>
						<li>
							After uploading a patch, always leave a comment on the ticket describing what you changed and why you changed it. A patch upload itself does not trigger a notification, and furthermore people wouldn't know the reasoning behind your changes.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Pro tip: Use <code>[attachment:{filename}]</code> to directly reference a specific patch on the ticket, and it will be automatically transformed into a link.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Make sure to adjust the keywords as necessary:
							<ul>
								<li>Add the <em>has-patch</em> keyword if you uploaded the initial patch.</li>
								<li>Add the <em>has-unit-tests</em> keyword if your patch already contains sufficient unit tests.</li>
								<li>Use the <em>dev-feedback</em> keyword if the patch is rather complex and could use thorough feedback on the approach.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Dealing with feedback</h4>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							If nobody responds to the ideas from your ticket or reviews your patch, it may be useful to bring that ticket forward in a related chat (more on that in just a bit). Make sure to ask kindly though, and don't annoy people. They're usually busy.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If the consensus is that your idea is not viable for inclusion in WordPress core, or if your patch does not fulfill the discussed requirements, stay focused. It is easy to get frustrated by such decisions. Try to move the discussion forward in a constructive way.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If you feel like your idea was rejected without a clear explanation, ask for the reasoning behind it. Contributors' times are often limited, so they unfortunately tend to write brief messages and omit things.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Always remember to not take anything personally. The other people (probably) don't know you, so why should they have any negative impression?
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>WordPress Slack</h2>

					<a href="https://wordpress.slack.com">https://wordpress.slack.com</a>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/slack.png">

					<p>
						Slack is a real-time communication platform used for contributing to WordPress. It is used by all areas of contributions with core being a significant part of it.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/slack-invite.png" style="max-width:50%;">

					<p>
						To get access to the Slack team, you need to request an (automated) invite at <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">https://make.wordpress.org/chat/</a>.
					</p>

					<small>Recommendation: Use the same username as your wordpress.org account.</small>

					<h3>Channels</h3>

					<p>
						There are 73 channels which you can join - however it is very unlikely you'll need all of them.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							You should definitely join the <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core">#core</a> channel. This is where the weekly development chat happens and where general discussions take place.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The rest depends on your preferences. There are several channels for specific core components, such as <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-media">#core-media</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-multisite">#core-multisite</a>, with separate meetings taking place in these channels.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If you're interested in focuses that overlap with other contributor groups, feel free to join their channels as well - examples are <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/accessibility">#accessibility</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/design">#design</a>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Last but not least, there are some channels dealing with specific feature projects, such as <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/feature-shortcode">#feature-shortcode</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/feature-shinyupdates">#feature-shinyupdates</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Meetings</h3>

					<p>
						There are several weekly meetings related to core,
						<br>
						which can be found in the sidebar of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">https://make.wordpress.org/core/</a>.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							<strong>Joining a meeting for your component is the best way to push forward your ideas and make yourself known.</strong> Be patient though: You should use the first couple of meetings to simply attend and get a feeling for how they work and who is responsible.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Joining the weekly dev-chat in <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core">#core</a> is also a good idea. You don't need to be around every week and you will realize it is mostly updates about what's currently being focused on. However, the most important decisions in WordPress development happen here - not one every week, but occasionally, so you might wanna be around to influence these decisions.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>If there is no meeting specific to your component, maybe ping the component maintainer or ask in the dev-chat.</li>
							<li>Some components are so small that it probably does not make sense for them to have a weekly meeting. You could still try to figure out a way to move them forward - maybe a less regular meeting every two months or so?</li>
							<li>As you gain more trust among the more seasoned contributors, it is a good idea to ask them to become a component maintainer.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Bug Scrubs</h3>

					<p>
						Bug scrubs are a special kind of meeting with the goal to reduce the number of open tickets (in general, or in a specific milestone).
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							<strong>Running a bug scrub is a great way to show your involvement.</strong> You should preferably have attended at least one scrub before, but leading a bug scrub is generally easier than leading a regular meeting.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The core team is always happy about volunteers to help with scrubbing bugs. If you're interested, respond to some of the calls that happen regularly, or just offer to run one during dev-chat or by pinging <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorbin">@jorbin</a> or <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">@jbpaul17</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>In a bug scrub, you go through a specific report (or custom query).</li>
							<li>This may for example be all tickets in the current major release (when it comes closer to Beta and Release Candidates), or all tickets in a specific component.</li>
						</ul>
