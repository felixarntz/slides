					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form.png" style="max-width:85%;">

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Let's go through all fields in detail.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-summary.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Brief summary of the ticket description.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: If you're filing a bug, describe what's wrong.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;HTML comments in posts aren't handled correctly&quot;
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: If you're filing an enhancement or feature request, use a call-to-action-type direction.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;Encourage people to change default tagline&quot;
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-description.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Ticket content: May be as long or as short as you like, but be precise.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: Do not use empty phrases, be on point. Tone on Trac is rather formal, so try to avoid things like &quot;I would love to see this!&quot; or similar.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Pro tip: You may reference another ticket by entering <code>#{ticket_id}</code>, and it will automatically become a link.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;This was previously discussed in #40000.&quot;
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Pro tip: You may reference a specific changeset by entering <code>[{changeset_id}]</code>, and it will automatically become a link.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: &quot;The original bug was fixed in [40000].&quot;
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>All of this applies to comments on tickets as well.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-type.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Ticket type: Either <em>defect (bug)</em>, <em>enhancement</em> or <em>feature request</em>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The vast majority of tickets are for bugs or enhancements.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							It's usually not a good idea to open a feature request ticket out of the blue. New feature ideas should be discussed in advance with others and only be transformed into a ticket once the idea has enough traction to be viable for a possible inclusion in WordPress Core.
							<br>
							&rarr; Furthermore, new features need to go through a special feature project workflow. See <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/">https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/31/iterating-on-feature-plugins/">https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/31/iterating-on-feature-plugins/</a> for more information.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							There is a fourth ticket type called <em>task (blessed)</em>. It is only available to component maintainers and committers and is intended to be used for task tickets, i.e. tickets that usually span multiple smaller sub-tickets to reach a bigger goal.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Differentiate between enhancements and feature requests!</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-version.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							This field should only be used when filing a bug.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							It should contain the number of the earliest version where the bug occurred. This is <em>not</em> necessarily the version of WordPress you are using.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If you're not sure which version to enter, leave the field blank, so someone else can add the information later.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Pro tip: If you already know where in the code the bug is coming from, you can use <code>svn blame {file}@r{changeset_id} | less</code> to work your way backwards and find out the earliest affected version.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: <code>svn blame src/wp-includes/post.php@r40000 | less</code><br>You can then use <code>400G</code> to go to line 400 and see the changeset number when that line was last changed.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-component.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The component to which the ticket belongs.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If it affects multiple components, choose the one it affects the most. You may further specify the related area by using focuses.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<img class="fragment" data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-focuses.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							A focus is something more general that usually spans across many, if not all WordPress Core components.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							While specifying a component is required, focuses are optional.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							If you file a ticket relates to multiple components and one of them is also available as a focus, use a mixture of component and focuses.
							<br>
							&rarr; Example: If you want to file a bug in the REST API taxonomy controller, use the <em>Taxonomy</em> component and the <em>rest-api</em> focus.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Please do not simply choose <em>General</em>, unless it's truly a general ticket!</li>

					<h4>The advanced New Ticket form</h4>

				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-milestone.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The milestone to which to assign the tickets. You may specify <em>Awaiting Review</em>, <em>Future Release</em>, the next major release or next minor release.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							When opening a ticket, you should usually keep this on <em>Awaiting Review</em> and ask for some initial feedback - especially if you're not filing a clear bug for which WordPress Core is responsible.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Minor releases should only be used to fix regressions (bugs) from the latest major release. This has changed a bit since the new release cycle, but it's still something to strive for.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: Only assign tickets to the upcoming release if sufficient discussions have already happened and you consider it realistic for the changes to be done in time.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Best practice: If you close a ticket without a successful resolution (more on that later), you should completely remove any milestone from the ticket.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-keywords.png">

					<ul style="font-size:80%;">
						<li class="fragment">
							Specify one or more keywords to indicate the current status of the ticket and required steps.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							This is supposed to be dynamic throughout the ticket's lifecycle, so you can (and should) change it after opening the ticket as necessary.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Available keywords are:
							<ul style="font-size:60%;">
								<li><em>has-patch</em>: A working patch has been uploaded.</li>
								<li><em>needs-patch</em>: The ticket still requires a working patch.</li>
								<li><em>needs-refresh</em>: There is a working patch, but the circumstances have changed, so a new patch is required.</li>
								<li><em>reporter-feedback</em>: Feedback by the person who opened the ticket requested.</li>
								<li><em>dev-feedback</em>: Feedback by developers requested, for example to review a patch.</li>
								<li><em>2nd-opinion</em>: Feedback requested for concepts / ideas, to start a discussion.</li>
								<li><em>close</em>: The ticket should probably be closed, but another voice would be welcome.</li>
								<li><em>needs-testing</em>: The patch on the ticket needs to be thoroughly tested (usually used for new features).</li>
								<li><em>ui-feedback</em>: Feedback requested for the UI changes the ticket deals with.</li>
								<li><em>ux-feedback</em>: Feedback requested for the UX changes the ticket deals with.</li>
								<li><em>has-unit-tests</em>: Comprehensive unit tests have been uploaded for the ticket.</li>
								<li><em>needs-unit-tests</em>: The ticket still requires unit tests.</li>
								<li><em>needs-docs</em>: The patch on the ticket still needs proper documentation.</li>
								<li><em>needs-codex</em>: The changes from the ticket require changes in the WordPress Codex.</li>
								<li><em>has-screenshots</em>: Screenshots for UI issues / changes have been uploaded.</li>
								<li><em>needs-screenshots</em>: The ticket still requires screenshots for UI issues / changes.</li>
								<li><em>commit</em>: The ticket, patch and everything related has been properly reviewed and is ready for commit.</li>
								<li><em>early</em>: The changes proposed in the ticket should be committed early in a release cycle to allow for thorough testing.</li>
								<li><em>i18n-change</em>: The changes in the ticket include i18n string changes.</li>
								<li><em>good-first-bug</em>: The ticket qualifies as a bug that should be relatively easy to fix for new contributors. Experienced contributors should preferably keep off, unless it's urgent.</li>
								<li><em>fixed-major</em>: The ticket has already been fixed in trunk, but requires back-porting to an older release.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Component maintainers and committers may furthermore enter manual keywords, for example <em>needs-dev-note</em> for when a ticket requires a dev-note.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-priority.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The priority of the ticket. Can be <em>normal</em>, <em>low</em>, <em>high</em>, <em>lowest</em> or <em>highest omg bbq</em>. No, this is not a joke. 🔥
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Always keep this at <em>normal</em>, unless specific circumstances dictate the value to be different or the ticket changes are nit-picking and not really needed.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Don't ever use this to mark something as important because you want it to happen!
						</li>
					</ul>

					<img class="fragment" data-src="assets/trac-newticket-form-advanced-severity.png">

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The severity of the ticket, if it is a bug. Can be <em>normal</em>, <em>major</em>, <em>minor</em>, <em>trivial</em>, <em>critical</em> or <em>blocker</em>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Should usually remain <em>normal</em> as well. <em>critical</em> can be used if the bug needs to be fixed as soon as possible, while <em>blocker</em> indicates that it should be fixed soon so that work on another related ticket can proceed.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Again, don't ever use this to mark something as important because you want it to happen!

					<h3>Closing a ticket</h3>

					<img data-src="assets/close-ticket-commit.png">

					<p style="margin-top:0;font-size:75%;">
						A ticket is automatically closed as <em>fixed</em>, when a commit message contains the phrase "Fixes #{ticket_id}.".
					</p>

					<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" data-src="assets/close-ticket-invalid.png">

					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="margin-top:0;font-size:75%;">
						If a ticket should not be fixed for a specific reason, it can be manually be closed with a proper resolution:
					</p>

					<ul class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="font-size:60%;">
						<li><em>invalid</em>: The ticket was not opened for a valid reason, for example when a bug only occurred because the reporter or a plugin clearly did something wrong.</li>
						<li><em>wontfix</em>: This may be considered a bug, but is not critical and cannot be fixed for (usually complex) legacy reasons.</li>
						<li><em>worksforme</em>: The issue described in the ticket cannot be recreated.</li>
						<li><em>maybelater</em>: This may be considered a bug, but is not critical and involves too heavy changes compared to the benefits. It may be reconsidered later.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Finding tickets</h3>

					<p>There are currently over 4700 open tickets in WordPress Trac.</p>

					<p class="fragment">&rarr; How do you find the ones that you wanna work on?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						A good starting point: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/</a>
					</p>

					<img data-src="assets/make-reports.png" style="max-width:70%;">

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>The page shows a selected list of important reports.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Reports</h4>

					<p>
						Reports are lists of tickets to which certain predefined criteria apply. Examples:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>All open tickets that are scheduled for the next major release.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that deal with the Customizer.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that need unit tests.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that are good for new contributors.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that are ready for commit.</li>
						<li>All open bug tickets that have been reported against trunk.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="fragment">
						&rarr; Can you name the criteria (from our previous <em>Opening a ticket</em> section) that a ticket needs to match in order to fall under each of the above reports respectively?
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						The full list of available reports can be found at <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report">https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report</a>.

					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Dynamic Reports</h4>

					<img data-src="assets/trac-reports-dynamic-required.png">

					<p style="margin-top:0;">
						Some reports require a dynamic parameter. Example usages:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/30?FOCUS=rest-api">https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/30?FOCUS=rest-api</a>

					<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" data-src="assets/trac-reports-dynamic-optional.png">

					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="margin-top:0;">
						Some reports support an optional dynamic parameter. Example usages:
					</p>

					<ul class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						<li><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/62">https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/62</a>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>The link to that page is pretty hidden, so try to remember the URL.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Query</h4>

					<img data-src="assets/trac-query.png" style="max-width:80%;">

					<p>
						This page allows you to query by any information available with granular control about relations, columns to show and orderby field.
					</p>

					<p class="fragment">
						&rarr; Let's go back to our previous reports. Can you generate these reports by using the custom query feature?
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-query.png" style="max-width:65%;">

					<p>
						Can you generate the following reports by using the custom query feature?
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>All open tickets that are scheduled for the next major release.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that deal with the Customizer.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that need unit tests.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that are good for new contributors.</li>
						<li>All open tickets that are ready for commit.</li>
						<li>All open bug tickets that have been reported against trunk.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>You can do much more than the reports allow, for example: Show all tickets for the next major release that are either in the <em>REST API</em> component or have the <em>rest-api</em> focus.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img data-src="assets/trac-query.png" style="max-width:80%;">

					<p>
						Pro tip: Now that you know how to use Trac's powerful query functionality, try to figure out over time which queries are useful to you regularly, and bookmark them for quick access.
